## Project API Services

<br>

### Address Book API

API methods contain the login information of the users in the requests of the posts. The transaction takes place through this information.

{
  "user": {
    "userEmail": "example@example.com",
    "userPassword": "examplePassword"
  }
}

Each user's address list can contain a person with the same name. This name will be sent to the server side in operations such as updating or deleting.

{
"info": {
		"name_surname":"updatedName"
	}
}

<br>

#### `POST >> "/api/add_address"`

This request; creates a new address record.

The information of the address to be created should be sent with the keyword "info".

{
	"info": {
		"name_surname":"exampleName",
		"address":"exampleAddress",
		"phone":"+905555555555",
		"workPhone":"+906666666666",
		"email":"example@example.com",
		"workEmail":"example@work.com",
		"companyName":"exampleCompany"
	}
}

When creating a new address, name, address and phone keywords should be sent.

<br>

#### `DELETE >> "/api/delete/by_name"`

This method deletes an address based on the "name_surname" information sent in the "info".

<br>

#### `UPDATE >> "/api/update_address"`

This method is just like creating a new address, but the "info" keyword must contain the name to be updated and the information to be updated must be sent within the "update" keyword.

<br>

#### `GET >> "/api/fetch/by_name"`

It is used to call all the data in the address information by name. The "info" keyword must contain the "name_surname".

<br>

#### `GET >> "/api/fetch/email"`

It is used to call all the data in the address information by email. The "info" keyword must contain the "email".

<br>

#### `GET >> "/api/fetch/phone"`

It is used to call all the data in the address information by phone. The "info" keyword must contain the "phone".

<br>

#### `GET >> "/api/fetch/all"`

It is used to call all addresses of the user. You don't need to send any information in "info".

<br>

### Response

Responses come as a json with two keywords. These are the keywords "answer" and "msg".

For example: { "answer": "success","msg": "address was deleted" }

The keyword "answer" takes two values, "success" and "error", and indicates whether the request was successful.

The "msg" keyword contains the reason for the "answer" key.
